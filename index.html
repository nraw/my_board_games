Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win. Along the way, you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward, odds, and logic - with dice woven into every aspect! Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest, when to explore, or even which fights to pursue! The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief, all while setting the stage for your next battle.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "330260", "name": "Chip Theory Games: Promo Pack 2018"}, {"id": "330268", "name": "Chip Theory Games: Promo Pack 2019"}, {"id": "330276", "name": "Chip Theory Games: Promo Pack 2020"}, {"id": "349753", "name": "Chip Theory Games: Promo Pack 2021"}, {"id": "383414", "name": "Chip Theory Games: Promo Pack 2022"}, {"id": "368600", "name": "Too Many Bones: 12 oz.

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.\n\nSpirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.\n\nThe Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.\n\nThe game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.\n\nThe game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony).

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.\n\nSpirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.\n\nThe Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.\n\nThe game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.\n\nThe game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony).

Each coin shows a military unit on one side and can be used for one of several actions.

To prove you are the one true inventor of time travel, you must use your invention to find your enemy in time and murder them \u2014 before they get you!\n\nUnfortunately, since your enemy has strewn many copies of themself across the timeline, you may have to do the terrible deed many, many times before it sticks. Just make sure you don't get erased first!\n\nThat Time You Killed Me is an abstract narrative game of time and murder that introduces new scenarios with unique rules and components as you play. As with any game about mucking about across time, you must play through this content in a strict, unalterable order.\n\nTo set up, place three game boards in a row to represent past, present, and future. Each player starts with a player piece in the same location on each 4x4 board, with the start player having their focus token in the past while the other has it in the future.\n\nOn a turn, choose a single copy of yourself on the board where your focus token is located, then take two actions with this copy, with actions being movement to an adjacent orthogonal space, time travel forward to the next board (travel from the past to the future is not allowed), or time travel back to the previous board, leaving a copy of yourself in the current location when you do. Sure, you traveled to the past, but if you stick around long enough, you'll be right back where you started, so now you're there, too! At the end of your turn, move your focus token to a different board.\n\nUnder the basic rules, you murder a copy of your opponent by pushing them into the wall of the game board. You have a limited number of copies of yourself in reserve, and murdered copies don't return to your reserve because that would be gross. If you run out of copies, you can no longer travel to the past since you can't leave a copy of yourself behind.\n\nIf on your turn, your opponent has copies of themselves on only one board, you win!\n\nPlay through four chapters of escalating difficulty, adding more wild time-travel shenanigans and unlocking more content as you master the game!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "351390", "name": "That Time You Killed Me: Consumption promo pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2021, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 1749, "average": 7.51951, "bayesaverage": 6.39093, "stddev": 1.36819, "median": 0.0, "owned": 4151, "trading": 94, "wanting": 268, "wishing": 2120, "numcomments": 340, "numweights": 33, "averageweight": 2.4242, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1452}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 40}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 21, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 18}, "2": {"best_rating": 21, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 19}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/344258", "average_rating": 7.51951, "short_name": "TTYKM", "last_played": "2024-04-13T00:00:00", "days_since_last_played": 27.0, "cool_name": "\ud83d\udd38 TTYKM"}, {"id": 277085, "name": "Love Letter", "players": 5, "best_player_count": "4", "is_best_player": false, "alternative_names": ["List mi\u0142osny (Edycja Premium)", "Love Letter: Segunda edi\u00e7\u00e3o", "Love Letter: Sender", "Milostn\u00fd dopis", "Szerelmes Lev\u00e9l", "\u041b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0445", "\u05de\u05db\u05ea\u05d1 \u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d4", "\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628", "\u0e08\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01", "\u60c5\u4e66", "\u60c5\u66f8", "\u72d0\u5996\u5c0f\u7ea2\u5a18\uff1a\u60c5\u4e66", "\ub7ec\ube0c \ub808\ud130", "\ucfe0\ud0a4\ub7f0 \ub7ec\ube0c\ub808\ud130"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V7WQjhAh0AatPXTYOrXtCQ__thumb/img/PNp3MFmie6ffR5RtyNs7TsVV4wA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4766499.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/V7WQjhAh0AatPXTYOrXtCQ__original/img/peOFPtAkzWUSpOSVTJu3pTDv2ck=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4766499.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Card Games: Draw and Discard", "Containers: Drawstring Bag", "Digital Implementations: Tabletopia", "Game: Love Letter", "Theme: Love / Romance"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Deduction", "Renaissance"], "implementations": ["Love Letter: Bridgerton", "Love Letter"], "mechanics": ["Deduction", "Hand Management", "Player Elimination", "Score-and-Reset Game", "Take That"], "designers": ["Seiji Kanai", "Alexandar Ortloff-Tang", "Justin Kemppainen"], "artists": ["Andrew Bosley", "Samuel R.

You must prove your worth and gain her trust by enlisting allies, friends, and family of the Princess to carry a letter of intent to her. Can you earn the Princess' trust and become her confidant?\n\nPlaying cards one at a time, players in Love Letter use the abilities of these key people in the Princess' life to outwit their opponents and successfully deliver their letter and gain her favor. Players must utilize each character's special skill to avoid being caught and successfully deliver their letter to the Princess.

Astonished by the strange aura of the Pagoda, you decide to investigate it. Suddenly, a laugh, a shadow which is not yours and an eye with ominous pretensions turns alive. You have broken the peace of ten powerful Japanese spirits (called Yokai) who rested there! Will you find a way to calm their wrath?\n\nA game of Yokai Pagoda is played through 3 rounds, playing always one card per turn, until someone ends the current round. To play a game, you shuffle the 100 number cards (divided by 10 kinds of Yokai, numbered from 1 to 10), lay out two cards face-up to start the two discard piles, then deal seven cards to each player.  Place the rest as the Pagoda deck, between the discard piles.\n\nWhen you play card, deal with one of the following effects:\n\n     Playing the same Yokai or the same number allows you to give someone one card from your hand.\n     With a different Yokai and a higher number you can take one random card from the deck -or- the first face-up card from the opposite dicard pile.\n     With a different Yokai and a lower number you can go on with the round as nothing happened -or- end the current round, but only if you have a total amount of three or less points in your hands.

Each player leads one of four armies: Borgo, Hegemonia (Hegemony), Moloch, and Posterunek (Outpost). Each army deck consists of 34 tiles: soldiers, support tiles, and special actions. You win when all enemy headquarters are destroyed or when your headquarters is the least damaged at the end of the game.\n\nThe second edition of Neuroshima Hex!, released at Spiel 2007, had updated graphics and a new, larger board; a special expansion pack sold at the same time included the Neuroshima Hex! Doomsday Machine 1.0, a fifth army that could be used against any of the other ones.\n\nThe first French edition of Neuroshima Hex!, released in 2008, included an additional four Mercenary tiles.

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2\u201310 in five different colors with three special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\n\nScoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, \u00d73 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.\n\nScoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, \u00d72 for the multiplier.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "206374", "name": "Lost Cities: Expedition 6 \u2013 The Lost Expedition"}, {"id": "282531", "name": "Lost Cities: Milestones"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1999, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 46256, "average": 7.2375, "bayesaverage": 7.13407, "stddev": 1.26684, "median": 0.0, "owned": 67234, "trading": 1023, "wanting": 553, "wishing": 5901, "numcomments": 10272, "numweights": 3137, "averageweight": 1.4785, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 331}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 78}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 432, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 338}, "2": {"best_rating": 407, "recommended_rating": 23, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2+": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 308}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50", "average_rating": 7.2375, "short_name": "Lost Cities", "last_played": "2023-09-06T00:00:00", "days_since_last_played": 247.0, "cool_name": "\ud83d\udd38 Lost Cities"}, {"id": 223770, "name": "Startups", "players": 5, "best_player_count": "4", "is_best_player": false, "alternative_names": ["\uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8\uc5c5\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Y23LsS9HxPgO0XT5RvtwTA__thumb/img/JQ6I0tZDYByNKmMSW0gsTiNulEQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3678411.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Y23LsS9HxPgO0XT5RvtwTA__original/img/IJW2fhjS4x88hu8Aap8XHrMfcyg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3678411.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Card Games: Draw and Discard", "Digital Implementations: Steam"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Economic"], "implementations": ["Rights"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Hot Potato", "Increase Value of Unchosen Resources", "Investment", "Score-and-Reset Game", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Jun Sasaki"], "artists": ["Hiroko Izumida", "Jun Sasaki"], "publishers": ["4 Kavky", "Oink Games", "Popcorn Games"], "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nThere are six companies that will change the world as we know it!

Each turn, players have two options:\n\n    play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card\n    pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card\n\n\nHowever, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game.  The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value.  Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.

In the first, the freezing phase, players will create the frozen lake in a contiguous form using their snowflake cards. They\u2019ll also attempt to secure zones in which they\u2019ve managed to group four snowflakes of their color using chips. In the second phase, the unfreezing, they\u2019ll undo the creation by moving and retrieving their cards and chips of their color. At the end of the game, the player with the most chips on the table is declared the winner.\n\nWinter is an abstract game for 2 players ages 8 and up. Games last 10 minutes in which good decisions are everything. This is a reissue of the 2016 edition with all new mechanics.\n\nWinter was the winner of the 2021 Cardboard Edison Award.

If players wish, they can play multiple rounds and sum their scores over the rounds to determine a winner.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "184028", "name": "Abluxxen: K\u00f6nigskarten"}, {"id": "167842", "name": "Abluxxen: Sonderkarten / Duell"}, {"id": "186885", "name": "Stadt Land Spielt Limitierte Sonderdrucke 2015"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 20, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 20, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 5154, "average": 6.99286, "bayesaverage": 6.55024, "stddev": 1.20341, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8562, "trading": 166, "wanting": 119, "wishing": 670, "numcomments": 1062, "numweights": 250, "averageweight": 1.396, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1109}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 301}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 117, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 65}, "2": {"best_rating": 9, "recommended_rating": 37, "not_recommended_rating": 47}, "3": {"best_rating": 24, "recommended_rating": 66, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "4": {"best_rating": 79, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 28, "recommended_rating": 59, "not_recommended_rating": 11}, "5+": {"best_rating": 2, "recommended_rating": 5, "not_recommended_rating": 46}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153065", "average_rating": 6.99286, "short_name": "Linko", "last_played": "2024-01-18T00:00:00", "days_since_last_played": 113.0, "cool_name": "Linko"}, {"id": 432, "name": "Take 5", "players": 3, "best_player_count": "5", "is_best_player": false, "alternative_names": ["!\u0634\u06cc\u0634 \u0642\u0644\u0648", "\u00a1Toma 6!", "6 bere!", "6 ima!", "6 neemt!", "6 nimmt!", "6 nimmt!

This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "416325", "name": "6 Nimmt: The Jumping Cow"}, {"id": "20030", "name": "6 nimmt!

which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.\n\nThe initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile \u2013 the safe room \u2013 and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:\n\n\n    A cursed mask \u2013 this die is set aside when rolled.\n    A golden mask \u2013 each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.\n    A red torch or blue key \u2013 these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.\n    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die \u2013 you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.\n\n\nEscape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you \"discover\" magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.\n\nThe real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.\n\nOnce the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.\n\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the \"Treasures\" module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the \"Curses\" module, some tiles \"curse\" players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "310234", "name": "Escape: Queenie Box"}, {"id": "310200", "name": "Escape: The Curse of the Temple \u2013 Exclusive Queenie 2020: Dice Shrine Chambers"}, {"id":

Every card is kept secret from other players.\n\nThe humans' objective is to save themselves using the escape hatches, while the aliens' objective is to hunt down the humans.

The Vault is a secure area, but the Showroom is vulnerable to theft by the other players.\n\nThe deck in Diamonds consists of sixty cards, numbered 1-15 in the standard suits. In each round, the players start with a hand of ten cards. One player leads a card, and everyone else must play one card, following suit if possible.  As you play a card, if you cannot follow suit, you immediately get a Suit Action in the suit you did play. The player who played the highest card in the suit that was led wins the trick, and also gets a Suit Action.\n The player who won the trick leads a card to start the next trick.

As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.\n\nWith the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.\n\nThe Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.\n\nPlayers have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.\n\nThe Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.\n\nThe miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.\n\nAction Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself.

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.\n\nThe game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.\n\nEach round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.\n\nIf they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round.

You have cards, your enemy has cards. You both cast some creatures and spells, then one of you wins.\n\nClose your eyes. Imagine you are a mighty lord commanding an army. Or a magician summoning creatures onto a battlefield. Or a farmer who grows his units on a cornfield right in the storm of battle. So you build your army, choose your enemy and try to bring the pain to him, before he brings the pain to you.\n\nBetween you and your enemy there are 2 tracks: one that your armies use to travel towards enemy, and a similar one where your enemy\u2019s units travel to you. Again, just imagine whatever you want \u2013 two epic castles in a war or a slow, magic-fest between old, smelly wizards with rheumatism.\n\nCards are everything here: your life bar, your mana, your library and so on. When you draw them into your hand you can either play them or discard them to pay for some more expensive, fancy card\u2019s cost. But there are even more decisions from here!\n\nWhen you play a card, you can play it as an instant and get a trigger effect. Alternatively, you can play it as a creature on your track, then its passive ability will work. It will defend you at first, and once it moves up to the end of your track, it will be able to:\na)    Activate (attack and trigger its effect)\nb)    Become your supporter (our fancy term for mana) \nc)    Or stay in the middle of the track and make its passive ability work all the time\n\nSo, you can build powerful combos, you can zombie-rush, you can build your economy and all sorts of other cool stuff. But whenever your enemy hits you, you will lose cards from your resources, so there is that. No cards to draw? You lose.\n\nIf you like it we might even get some expansions going pretty soon.\n\nA co-op mode has also been added.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "257340", "name": "SiegeStorm: Shade Slayers"}, {"id": "362929", "name": "Siege Storm: Gunslingers"}, {"id": "257338", "name": "SiegeStorm: Frost Giants"}, {"id": "257339", "name": "SiegeStorm: Wild Fairies"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 629, "average": 6.44949, "bayesaverage": 5.69723, "stddev": 1.56334, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2565, "trading": 195, "wanting": 7, "wishing": 115, "numcomments": 225, "numweights": 11, "averageweight": 2.6364, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 5738}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 7, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 3, "not_recommended_rating": 3}, "2": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 3}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/242343", "average_rating": 6.44949, "short_name": "Siege Storm", "last_played": "2023-12-23T00:00:00", "days_since_last_played": 139.0, "cool_name": "\ud83d\udd38 Siege Storm"}, {"id": 180602, "name": "Game of Trains", "players": 3, "best_player_count": "3", "is_best_player": true, "alternative_names": ["Game of trains \u8ff7\u9014\u5c0f\u706b\u8eca", "Gra o Tor", "S\u00ednen vagyunk"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CawgoeUEMFS4f14Iix9Exg__thumb/img/OYsku3__TTw8fiFYEWlhUBT7nIU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic2608713.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/CawgoeUEMFS4f14Iix9Exg__original/img/MKbbB_sZllcuV68D3b63jHvtr48=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic2608713.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Digital Implementations: Tabletopia"], "categories": ["Card Game", "Puzzle", "Trains"], "implementations": ["\u0427\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438 (Wonderful Towers)"], "mechanics": ["Open Drafting", "Ordering", "Pattern Building"], "designers": ["Alexey Konnov", "Alexey Paltsev", "Anatoliy Shklyarov", "Trehgrannik"], "artists": ["Reinis P\u0113tersons"], "publishers": ["Brain Games", "ABACUSSPIELE", "Broadway Toys LTD", "DV Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "Reflexshop", "SD Games", "Story Factory"], "description": "In Game of Trains, each player is in charge of their line of trains.
