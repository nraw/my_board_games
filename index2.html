Just make sure you don't get erased first!\n\nThat Time You Killed Me is an abstract narrative game of time and murder that introduces new scenarios with unique rules and components as you play. As with any game about mucking about across time, you must play through this content in a strict, unalterable order.\n\nTo set up, place three game boards in a row to represent past, present, and future. Each player starts with a player piece in the same location on each 4x4 board, with the start player having their focus token in the past while the other has it in the future.\n\nOn a turn, choose a single copy of yourself on the board where your focus token is located, then take two actions with this copy, with actions being movement to an adjacent orthogonal space, time travel forward to the next board (travel from the past to the future is not allowed), or time travel back to the previous board, leaving a copy of yourself in the current location when you do. Sure, you traveled to the past, but if you stick around long enough, you'll be right back where you started, so now you're there, too! At the end of your turn, move your focus token to a different board.\n\nUnder the basic rules, you murder a copy of your opponent by pushing them into the wall of the game board. You have a limited number of copies of yourself in reserve, and murdered copies don't return to your reserve because that would be gross. If you run out of copies, you can no longer travel to the past since you can't leave a copy of yourself behind.\n\nIf on your turn, your opponent has copies of themselves on only one board, you win!\n\nPlay through four chapters of escalating difficulty, adding more wild time-travel shenanigans and unlocking more content as you master the game!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "351390", "name": "That Time You Killed Me: Consumption promo pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2021, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 452, "average": 7.78747, "bayesaverage": 5.93262, "stddev": 1.26346, "median": 0.0, "owned": 1191, "trading": 27, "wanting": 254, "wishing": 1490, "numcomments": 118, "numweights": 8, "averageweight": 2.625, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2973}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 76}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 6, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 5}, "2": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 5}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/344258", "average_rating": 7.78747, "short_name": "TTYKM"}, {"id": 154597, "name": "Hive Pocket", "players": 2, "alternative_names": ["Hive Carbon", "\u87f2\u87f2\u653b\u9632\u6230 \u4fbf\u651c\u7248", "\ud558\uc774\ube0c \ucf64\ud329\ud2b8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4DffKExiPihIf9T_AqkPCQ__thumb/img/0EuD6uQ0lLAb2jtY6YC0EduW7Gw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1299877.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/4DffKExiPihIf9T_AqkPCQ__original/img/00AgwqL0q6j08AE3CfKOPm1S17c=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1299877.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Ants", "Animals: Bees", "Animals: Grasshoppers", "Animals: Insects", "Animals: Ladybugs / Ladybirds", "Animals: Spiders", "Category: Combinatorial", "Containers: Drawstring Bag", "Containers: Zippered Pouch", "Game: Hive", "Misc: Mensa Select", "Players: Two Player Only Games"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Animals"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Enclosure", "Grid Movement", "Hexagon Grid", "Pieces as Map", "Slide/Push", "Three Dimensional Movement", "Tile Placement"], "designers": ["John Yianni"], "artists": ["John Yianni"], "publishers": ["Gen42 Games", "Asmodee", "AURUM, Inc.", "FunBox Jogos", "Ghenos Games", "HUCH!", "Jolly Thinkers", "Morning Players", "Smart Zone Games", "Story Factory", "uplay.it edizioni", "Vendetta", "Zhiyanjia", "\u0406\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0433"], "description": "Hive is a strategic game for two players that is not restricted by a board and can be played anywhere on any flat surface.

The order you play your Battle cards is critical, and so is how you play them. All cards can either be played face-up or face-down. Playing a card face-up triggers its Tactical Ability, but the card must be played in its corresponding theater. Face-down cards are wild and can be played to any theater, but only have a strength of 2 and do not grant Tactical Abilities.\n\nAt the start of each battle, you will be dealt a hand of six cards. You will not draw additional cards during the Battle, so you must formulate your strategy based on only these cards. Players take turns playing Battle cards one at a time, until all cards have been played, or one player decides to withdraw.\n\nYou do not have to continue a Battle to the very end. Sometimes, it may be best to withdraw in order to deny your opponent complete victory! In Air, Land, & Sea, a strategic withdraw may lose you the battle to ultimately win the war!  Victory points are awarded at the end of each Battle based on the results, and the first player to 12 victory points wins the war!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "314335", "name": "Air, Land & Sea: Ultimatum Promo Card"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 14, "stats": {"usersrated": 4152, "average": 7.50609, "bayesaverage": 6.88747, "stddev": 1.11455, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8158, "trading": 167, "wanting": 255, "wishing": 1750, "numcomments": 980, "numweights": 73, "averageweight": 1.7671, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 535}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 312}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 23, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 16}, "2": {"best_rating": 23, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 17}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/247367", "average_rating": 7.50609, "short_name": "Air, Land, & Sea"}, {"id": 252399, "name": "Vast: The Mysterious Manor", "players": 3, "alternative_names": [], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vf3kkCiduusDO0nZclyosA__thumb/img/m-_Uyh4A8x6Tj9hTS50F12FWliY=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4118006.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Vf3kkCiduusDO0nZclyosA__original/img/0KVaIA-66yW55bJF84DiL1Tq-54=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic4118006.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Crowdfunding: Kickstarter", "Game: Vast"], "categories": ["Adventure", "Exploration", "Fantasy"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Action Points", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Modular Board", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Patrick Leder"], "artists": ["Kyle Ferrin"], "publishers": ["Leder Games", "Matagot"], "description": "The manor has sat in the shady part of the valley abandoned for generations.

The world was bestowed with great spirit, which lifted the animals of the land to new heights. Unfortunately, over the years these clans lost touch with the spirit of the land and faction warring developed. The Foxen Kingdom of Skulk Hollow in the South, The spiritual Red Pandas of Cupboard in the North, the Mischievous Mice of Multon in the West, and the colony of Blackheart Bunnies in the East. As skirmishes started breaking out across the continent, lives lost, there was a monstrous shake and then The Great Return. No one quite knows why, but the Guardians have risen - but not the kind, life-giving Guardians of spiritual legend. Dark, ferocious, versions that are now attacking all the kingdoms of the land.\n\nOBJECTIVE\nIn Skulk Hollow, two players take the roles of either a towering behemoth of a Guardian trying to eliminate the clans of foxes who have been causing havoc on the countryside, or a band of foxen heroes out to vanquish the evil beast that has been terrorizing the land and reunite the four kingdoms of B\u00f8re.\n\nThe Guardian wins the game by either eliminating the Foxen King, or by gaining enough Tribute.\n\nThe Foxen Heroes wins the game by eliminating the Guardian.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nSkulk Hollow is a 2-player, asymmetric, tactical combat game. Player use action cards to move their units, summon, and use special abilities. Taking down a guardian requires the Foxen player to leap onto the Guardian player board and take out different parts of the character.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "287108", "name": "Skulk Hollow: Ancient Relics Mini-Expansion"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2019, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 40, "minplaytime": 40, "maxplaytime": 40, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 1540, "average": 7.35388, "bayesaverage": 6.32981, "stddev": 1.32671, "median": 0.0, "owned": 3712, "trading": 82, "wanting": 250, "wishing": 1642, "numcomments": 367, "numweights": 35, "averageweight": 2.2571, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 1461}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 765}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 11, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "2": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "2+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 8}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/232595", "average_rating": 7.35388, "short_name": "Skulk Hollow"}, {"id": 299169, "name": "Spicy", "players": 2, "alternative_names": ["3 Tigres", "Pikantn\u00ed ko\u010dky", "\u8c93\u54033\u8fa3", "\uc2a4\ud30c\uc774\uc2dc"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eLJJ7f5I106enEFkSfxmnQ__thumb/img/nyTH5PgSWie1DZMZVJ7tnzEL-hk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic5181748.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/eLJJ7f5I106enEFkSfxmnQ__original/img/dH1wpQ36ZJDG-uur4JAAcoz8CY8=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic5181748.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Animals: Cats", "Series: Mini Games (IELLO)", "Series: Radiant Culture Series (HeidelB\u00c4R)", "Theme: Food / Cooking"], "categories": ["Animals", "Bluffing", "Card Game"], "implementations": ["Sweet & Spicy"], "mechanics": ["Hand Management"], "designers": ["Gy\u0151ri Zolt\u00e1n G\u00e1bor"], "artists": ["Jimin Kim"], "publishers": ["HeidelB\u00c4R Games", "999 Games", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Asmodee", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "Heidelbear Korea", "IELLO", "MEBO Games", "Studio Supernova", "Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.", "UBO CnC"], "description": "Once upon a time, three big cats became exhausted fighting to be top cat.

If the fake artist is not caught, both the fake artist and the Question Master earn points; if the fake artist is caught and cannot guess what the word is, the artists earn points.\n\n", "expansions": [], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2012, "minplayers": 5, "maxplayers": 10, "playingtime": 20, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 20, "minage": 8, "stats": {"usersrated": 6213, "average": 7.16366, "bayesaverage": 6.77733, "stddev": 1.25547, "median": 0.0, "owned": 10850, "trading": 121, "wanting": 292, "wishing": 2227, "numcomments": 1205, "numweights": 108, "averageweight": 1.1389, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 655}, {"id": "5498", "name": "partygames", "friendlyname": "Party Game Rank", "value": 34}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 57, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "2": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 37}, "3": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 36}, "4": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 15, "not_recommended_rating": 22}, "5": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 25, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "6": {"best_rating": 37, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "7": {"best_rating": 27, "recommended_rating": 13, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "8": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 27, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "9": {"best_rating": 4, "recommended_rating": 26, "not_recommended_rating": 8}, "10": {"best_rating": 3, "recommended_rating": 21, "not_recommended_rating": 13}, "10+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 10, "not_recommended_rating": 21}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/135779", "average_rating": 7.16366, "short_name": "AFAGtNY"}, {"id": 223770, "name": "Startups", "players": 5, "alternative_names": ["\uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8 \uc5c5\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Y23LsS9HxPgO0XT5RvtwTA__thumb/img/JQ6I0tZDYByNKmMSW0gsTiNulEQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3678411.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Y23LsS9HxPgO0XT5RvtwTA__original/img/IJW2fhjS4x88hu8Aap8XHrMfcyg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3678411.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Card Games: Draw and Discard"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": ["Rights"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Hot Potato", "Investment", "Score-and-Reset Game", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Jun Sasaki"], "artists": ["Hiroko Izumida", "Jun Sasaki"], "publishers": ["Oink Games", "PopcornEdu"], "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nThere are six companies that will change the world as we know it!

(Jokers can be played on their own, and they are considered to be higher than all values.)\n\nAs soon as the deck runs out of cards or a player has no cards in hand, the game ends immediately, even if the player would normally abluxx an opponent. Each player scores one point for each card on the table in front of him, then loses one point for each card in hand. Whoever has the highest score wins. If players wish, they can play multiple rounds and sum their scores over the rounds to determine a winner.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "184028", "name": "Abluxxen: K\u00f6nigskarten"}, {"id": "167842", "name": "Abluxxen: Sonderkarten / Duell"}, {"id": "186885", "name": "Stadt Land Spielt Limitierte Sonderdrucke 2015"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2014, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 5, "playingtime": 20, "minplaytime": 20, "maxplaytime": 20, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 4518, "average": 6.99441, "bayesaverage": 6.56136, "stddev": 1.21412, "median": 0.0, "owned": 7112, "trading": 149, "wanting": 111, "wishing": 619, "numcomments": 938, "numweights": 229, "averageweight": 1.3974, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 996}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 249}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 101, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 58}, "2": {"best_rating": 7, "recommended_rating": 36, "not_recommended_rating": 38}, "3": {"best_rating": 20, "recommended_rating": 60, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "4": {"best_rating": 68, "recommended_rating": 20, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "5": {"best_rating": 26, "recommended_rating": 50, "not_recommended_rating": 10}, "5+": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 4, "not_recommended_rating": 42}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153065", "average_rating": 6.99441, "short_name": "Linko!"}, {"id": 169654, "name": "Deep Sea Adventure", "players": 3, "alternative_names": ["Tiefseeabenteuer", "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435", "\u6d77\u5e95\u63a2\u967a", "\ud574\uc800\ud0d0\ud5d8"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/owyKXaa5SPB2HG9F_MueNQ__thumb/img/poEY0PMTpz4X_SOUaPjs6G7qr7o=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3169827.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/owyKXaa5SPB2HG9F_MueNQ__original/img/gOmpUB3hM7Ap9o-kDsV8ZVBVYXA=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3169827.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Polyhedral (not D6) dice", "Theme: Submarines", "Theme: Under the Sea"], "categories": ["Dice", "Exploration", "Nautical", "Party Game"], "implementations": ["Moon Adventure"], "mechanics": ["Pick-up and Deliver", "Push Your Luck", "Roll / Spin and Move"], "designers": ["Jun Sasaki", "Goro Sasaki"], "artists": ["Jun Sasaki"], "publishers": ["Oink Games", "Lavka Games", "PopcornEdu", "Tower Tactic Games"], "description": "A group of poor explorers hoping to get rich quickly heads out to recover treasures from some undersea ruins.

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.\n\nTo play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.\n\nIn addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!\n\n6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have.

Players take turns drawing cards and combining their special abilities to plunder the most loot without busting their entire hands.\n\nThe core of your turn in Dead Man\u2019s Draw is all in the flip: pulling the top card off the deck and using its special ability. Your turn isn\u2019t over until you say it is, though. You can keep pulling cards as long as you like \u2013 until you play a card of a suit already seen, at which point you lose everything. Knowing when to stop and \"bank\" your cards is the biggest decision you make in Dead Man\u2019s Draw, but being too timid lets braver opponents pass you up with bigger, more profitable turns.\n\nThe cards\u2019 special abilities are key to success in Dead Man\u2019s Draw, and they build off of each other.

It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.\n\nIn more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.\n\nYou start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life. Complete all the levels, and you win!\n\nFor an extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down.

After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.\n\nWith the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.\n\nThe Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.\n\nPlayers have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.\n\nThe Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards.

You must figure out which of these new, zany characters are real and which ones are parasites that need to be exterminated.  Think you've got what it takes to save the world?\n\nThe game features a basic fully cooperative mode and an advanced mode, where there are two teams.\nIn the advanced mode, players will be dealt a hidden role as either Real or a Parasite. The Parasite players must try to keep at least one parasite alive in the end (keeping yourself alive is the easiest way to do this). The Real players must root out the Parasites to win.\nNow you can shoot the other players!
