As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.\n\nSpirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.\n\nThe Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.\n\nThe game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.\n\nThe game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony).

At the start of the game, raise your banner call (drafting) several various units into your army, which you then use to capture key points on the board.

During set-up, whoever is shuffling the cards should randomize both the order of the cards in the deck and their orientation. Once each player has been dealt their entire hand of cards, they pick up that hand without rearranging any of the cards; if they wish, they can rotate their entire hand of cards in order to use the values on the other end of each card, but again they cannot rearrange the order of cards in their hand.\n\nOn a turn, a player takes one of two actions:\n\n\u2022 Play: A player chooses one or more adjacent cards in their hand that have all the same value or that have values in consecutive order (whether ascending or descending), then they play this set of cards to the table. They can do this only if the table is empty (as on the first turn) or the set they're playing is ranked higher than the set currently on the table; a set is higher if it has more cards or has cards of the same value instead of consecutive cards or has a set of the same quantity and type but with higher values. In this latter case when a player overplays another set, the player captures the cards in this previous set and places them face down in front of themselves.\n\n\u2022 Scout: A player takes a card from either end of the set currently on the table and places it anywhere they wish in their hand in either orientation.

Each player starts with a player piece in the same location on each 4x4 board, with the start player having their focus token in the past while the other has it in the future.\n\nOn a turn, choose a single copy of yourself on the board where your focus token is located, then take two actions with this copy, with actions being movement to an adjacent orthogonal space, time travel forward to the next board (travel from the past to the future is not allowed), or time travel back to the previous board, leaving a copy of yourself in the current location when you do. Sure, you traveled to the past, but if you stick around long enough, you'll be right back where you started, so now you're there, too! At the end of your turn, move your focus token to a different board.\n\nUnder the basic rules, you murder a copy of your opponent by pushing them into the wall of the game board. You have a limited number of copies of yourself in reserve, and murdered copies don't return to your reserve because that would be gross. If you run out of copies, you can no longer travel to the past since you can't leave a copy of yourself behind.\n\nIf on your turn, your opponent has copies of themselves on only one board, you win!\n\nPlay through four chapters of escalating difficulty, adding more wild time-travel shenanigans and unlocking more content as you master the game!\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "351390", "name": "That Time You Killed Me: Consumption promo pack"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2021, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 15, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 847, "average": 7.64372, "bayesaverage": 6.12579, "stddev": 1.33326, "median": 0.0, "owned": 2248, "trading": 47, "wanting": 254, "wishing": 1765, "numcomments": 188, "numweights": 15, "averageweight": 2.5333, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 2198}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 47}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 10, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 9}, "2": {"best_rating": 10, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 0}, "2+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 0, "not_recommended_rating": 9}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/344258", "average_rating": 7.64372, "short_name": "TTYKM"}, {"id": 254640, "name": "Just One", "players": 7, "alternative_names": ["Ainult \u00dcks", "Csak egy", "Jedn\u00edm slovem", "Jednym s\u0142owem", "Just One: \u039c\u03b9\u03b1 \u039b\u03ad\u03be\u03b7 \u039c\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf", "S\u00f3 uma", "Tikai viens", "\u0415\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430", "\u041d\u0430\u043c\u0451\u043a \u041f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b!", "\u041e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c", "\u05d1\u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d7\u05ea", "\u30b8\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30ef\u30f3", "\u7368\u5bb6\u6697\u8a9e", "\uc800\uc2a4\ud2b8 \uc6d0!"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qKcKjHpzAvLddwBhyindag__thumb/img/HhZu2qLp9wyX9PNgvmDE8_hCl-0=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4268499.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/qKcKjHpzAvLddwBhyindag__original/img/NPUrOSJ5NEC7aPkoEXnTHJ7vICU=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4268499.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Components: Dry Erase Markers / Dry Erase Surfaces", "Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena", "Mechanism: Give a Clue / Get a Clue", "Misc: LongPack Games", "Word Games: Guess the Word"], "categories": ["Party Game", "Word Game"], "implementations": ["We Are The Word"], "mechanics": ["Communication Limits", "Cooperative Game"], "designers": ["Ludovic Roudy", "Bruno Sautter"], "artists": ["\u00c9ric Azagury", "Florian Poullet"], "publishers": ["Repos Production", "ADC Blackfire Entertainment", "Arclight Games", "Brain Games", "FoxMind Israel", "Fun Consortium", "Gal\u00e1pagos Jogos", "Geekach Games", "G\u00e9m Klub Kft.", "GoKids \u73a9\u6a02\u5c0f\u5b50", "Happy Baobab", "Kaissa Chess & Games", "Korea Boardgames Co., Ltd.", "Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd", "Mald\u00f3n", "Morapiaf", "Rebel Sp. z o.o."], "description": "Just One is a cooperative party game in which you play together to discover as many mystery words as possible.

Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp.\n\nThis classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more!\n\nIn Cosmic Encounter, each player becomes the leader of one of dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power. On a player's turn, he or she becomes the offense. The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet. Both sides can invite allies and play cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.\n\nThe object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems.

The order you play your Battle cards is critical, and so is how you play them. All cards can either be played face-up or face-down. Playing a card face-up triggers its Tactical Ability, but the card must be played in its corresponding theater. Face-down cards are wild and can be played to any theater, but only have a strength of 2 and do not grant Tactical Abilities.\n\nAt the start of each battle, you will be dealt a hand of six cards. You will not draw additional cards during the Battle, so you must formulate your strategy based on only these cards. Players take turns playing Battle cards one at a time, until all cards have been played, or one player decides to withdraw.\n\nYou do not have to continue a Battle to the very end. Sometimes, it may be best to withdraw in order to deny your opponent complete victory! In Air, Land, & Sea, a strategic withdraw may lose you the battle to ultimately win the war!

The more you injure your opponents, the better you fare in the tournament.

There is a fifth card that cannot be used by either player.

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2\u201310 in five different colors with three special \"handshakes\" (\"HS\" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\n\nThe object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\n\nThe game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\n\nScoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\n\nScoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, \u00d73 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.\n\nScoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, \u00d72 for the multiplier.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "206374", "name": "Lost Cities: Expedition 6 \u2013 The Lost Expedition"}, {"id": "282531", "name": "Lost Cities: Milestones"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 1999, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 2, "playingtime": 30, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 30, "minage": 10, "stats": {"usersrated": 43376, "average": 7.21693, "bayesaverage": 7.1163, "stddev": 1.26753, "median": 0.0, "owned": 61791, "trading": 975, "wanting": 547, "wishing": 5303, "numcomments": 9817, "numweights": 3054, "averageweight": 1.4833, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 326}, {"id": "5499", "name": "familygames", "friendlyname": "Family Game Rank", "value": 69}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 397, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 1, "recommended_rating": 6, "not_recommended_rating": 305}, "2": {"best_rating": 373, "recommended_rating": 22, "not_recommended_rating": 2}, "2+": {"best_rating": 6, "recommended_rating": 7, "not_recommended_rating": 280}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50", "average_rating": 7.21693, "short_name": "Lost Cities"}, {"id": 223770, "name": "Startups", "players": 5, "alternative_names": ["\uc2a4\ud0c0\ud2b8 \uc5c5\uc2a4"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Y23LsS9HxPgO0XT5RvtwTA__thumb/img/JQ6I0tZDYByNKmMSW0gsTiNulEQ=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3678411.png", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Y23LsS9HxPgO0XT5RvtwTA__original/img/IJW2fhjS4x88hu8Aap8XHrMfcyg=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic3678411.png", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Card Games: Draw and Discard", "Digital Implementations: Steam"], "categories": ["Card Game"], "implementations": ["Rights"], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Hot Potato", "Investment", "Score-and-Reset Game", "Set Collection"], "designers": ["Jun Sasaki"], "artists": ["Hiroko Izumida", "Jun Sasaki"], "publishers": ["4 Kavky", "Oink Games", "PopcornEdu"], "description": "Description from the publisher:\n\nThere are six companies that will change the world as we know it!

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent\u2019s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.\n\nThe game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings \u2013 or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.\n\nTash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.\n\nIn melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don't expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score.\n\nThe rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent's moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.\n\n", "expansions": [{"id": "235803", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Etherweave"}, {"id": "165524", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Everfrost"}, {"id": "169370", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Legendary Summoner Promo"}, {"id": "266580", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Love Elemental Promo Card"}, {"id": "180484", "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends \u2013 Nethervoid"}], "expands": [], "yearpublished": 2013, "minplayers": 2, "maxplayers": 4, "playingtime": 60, "minplaytime": 30, "maxplaytime": 60, "minage": 13, "stats": {"usersrated": 6848, "average": 7.16522, "bayesaverage": 6.7779, "stddev": 1.52677, "median": 0.0, "owned": 8775, "trading": 344, "wanting": 253, "wishing": 1750, "numcomments": 1396, "numweights": 295, "averageweight": 2.8441, "ranks": [{"id": "1", "name": "boardgame", "friendlyname": "Board Game Rank", "value": 682}, {"id": "4666", "name": "abstracts", "friendlyname": "Abstract Game Rank", "value": 39}, {"id": "5497", "name": "strategygames", "friendlyname": "Strategy Game Rank", "value": 440}]}, "suggested_players": {"total_votes": 145, "results": {"1": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 1, "not_recommended_rating": 73}, "2": {"best_rating": 124, "recommended_rating": 17, "not_recommended_rating": 1}, "3": {"best_rating": 12, "recommended_rating": 59, "not_recommended_rating": 34}, "4": {"best_rating": 13, "recommended_rating": 50, "not_recommended_rating": 39}, "4+": {"best_rating": 0, "recommended_rating": 2, "not_recommended_rating": 68}}}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146278", "average_rating": 7.16522, "short_name": "Tash-Kalar"}, {"id": 146278, "name": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends", "players": 3, "alternative_names": ["Die Arena von Tash-Kalar", "Tash Kalar: Arena de Leyendas", "Tash-Kalar: Ar\u00e9na Legend", "Tash-Kalar: L'Arena Leggendaria", "Tash-Kalar: L'Ar\u00e8ne Des L\u00e9gendes", "Tash-Kalar: Legendarna Arena", "\u30bf\u30b7\u30e5=\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30eb\uff1a\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u95d8\u6280\u5834", "\u5854\u4ec0-\u5361\u62c9\u723e\uff1a\u50b3\u5947\u7af6\u6280\u5834"], "thumbnail": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/woifEuhjEe-0VPKtPcwaIw__thumb/img/PwCqGHn47oqbKt7aJdkhKb4JG_A=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1875045.jpg", "image": "https://cf.geekdo-images.com/woifEuhjEe-0VPKtPcwaIw__original/img/EisNAxSKPu0TQOv0KKiPBGdetQ8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1875045.jpg", "expansion": false, "accessory": false, "families": ["Digital Implementations: Board Game Arena", "Game: Tash-Kalar"], "categories": ["Abstract Strategy", "Card Game", "Fantasy", "Fighting"], "implementations": [], "mechanics": ["Area Majority / Influence", "Catch the Leader", "Grid Movement", "Hand Management", "Highest-Lowest Scoring", "Pattern Building", "Team-Based Game", "Tile Placement", "Variable Player Powers"], "designers": ["Vlaada Chv\u00e1til"], "artists": ["David Cochard"], "publishers": ["Czech Games Edition", "Cranio Creations", "GaGa Games", "Heidelberger Spieleverlag", "Hobby Japan", "IELLO", "One Moment Games", "Rebel Sp. z o.o.", "REXhry", "Z-Man Games", "Zacatrus"], "description": "Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends is a game played by masters of magic.

For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from 1\u20135. Sounds easy, right?

Stealing cards can be good, but if you can't use them later, and end the game with cards in hand, they'll cost you points.\n\nIn more detail, the deck contains 104 number cards (1-13 x8) and five joker cards. Each player starts with a hand of 13 cards, and six cards are laid face-up next to the deck. On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same value, adding jokers if desired; if she already has cards on the table, she lays these cards so that previously played cards are still visible. If any opponent has most recently played the same number of cards and those cards are of a lower value, then the active player \"abluxxes\" those opponents \u2014 that is, the active player can take the abluxxed cards into her hand and the opponent then draws the same number of cards, either from the display or the deck; if she doesn't take these cards in hand, then the opponent either returns these cards to his hand or discards them and draws that many cards. Refill the display only after someone finishes drawing cards. (Jokers can be played on their own, and they are considered to be higher than all values.)\n\nAs soon as the deck runs out of cards or a player has no cards in hand, the game ends immediately, even if the player would normally abluxx an opponent.

Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play.\n\nSuit Actions will enable players to take Diamond Crystals from the Supply, moving them to their Showroom (where they may score 1 point) or to their Vault (where they will score 2 points). The Vault is a secure area, but the Showroom is vulnerable to theft by the other players.\n\nThe deck in Diamonds consists of sixty cards, numbered 1-15 in the standard suits. In each round, the players start with a hand of ten cards. One player leads a card, and everyone else must play one card, following suit if possible.  As you play a card, if you cannot follow suit, you immediately get a Suit Action in the suit you did play.

You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.\n\nYou start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life. Complete all the levels, and you win!\n\nFor an extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down.

As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.\n\nWith the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.\n\nThe Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.\n\nPlayers have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.\n\nThe Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards.
